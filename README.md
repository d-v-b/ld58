## Controls
- `a` or `left arrow` moves the player left
- `d` or `right arrow` moves the player right
- `spacebar` makes the player jump
- `left click` or `f` makes the player swing the mining pick
- `x` kills the player at any time

## Goal
Collect points by mining blocks, collecting diamonds, and isolating bomb blocks. 
Mining a block awards more points if it's surrounded by bombs. Bomb blocks are isolated by mining all
the non-bomb blocks around them. And diamonds are simple -- you just walk over them. But if you end 
up mining a bomb block, you are *instantly annihilated*, and all your hard-earned points are gone.
